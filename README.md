# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust!

## Prerequisites

- Up-to-date Rust toolchain (`rustup`, `rustc`, `cargo`)

## Puzzle inputs

The inputs are different for every Advent of Code account, so you need to download your own.

Add them under `inputs` in the following format:

```
aoc-2022
├── inputs
│   ├── day1.txt
│   └── day2.txt
...
```

## Puzzle solutions

Execute the following (replace `1` with the number you want)

```bash
cargo r --bin day1
```
